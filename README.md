# Pentago

## Summary

Pentago is a project carried out by students of [ISEN-Toulon](https://www.isen.fr/).

Pentago is a Swedish game. It was invented in 2005 by Tomas Flodén and published by the Swedish company Mindtwister. He has been awarded numerous prizes such as 'Game of the Year' in Sweden and in several countries.

The principle of the game is simple: you have a large empty game board, perforated with 36 cavities. This large tray consists of 4 mini trays, each with 9 cavities.

The player who starts the game places a ball in a cavity of his choice. After depositing the ball, the player rotates one of the four parts of the large board a quarter turn clockwise or counterclockwise.

On each game turn, the player must rotate one of the mini-plateaux, even if it is a board on which he has not placed a ball.

The first player who manages to line up 5 balls of his color wins the game.

An alignment can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal and can extend over two or three mini trays. When one of the players manages to line up 5 balls on a row by placing a ball in a cavity, he must no longer turn one of the mini trays.

A match is declared a draw when all the cavities have been filled without reaching an alignment of five identical balls. Similarly, the game is tied if two players line up five balls of their own color after a player has rotated one of the mini-plateaux.
